    <h2>Our Imperfect Dog</h2>
    
    <p>By Cynthia C. Naspinksi</p> 
    
    <p>We love our dog with all our hearts,<br>But not so much her stinky farts.<br>Her doggy breath is less than fresh,<br>Yet we hug her nonetheless.</p>
        
    <p>She wages war with the lawn mower,<br>Outdoor sweeper and leaf blower.<br>And switching on the vacuum cleaner,<br>Won't bring out her best demeanor.</p>

    <p>This causes some embarrassment,<br>This doggy form of harassment.<br>But she does provide protection,<br>And for that we feel affection.</p>

    <p>Once introductions make the rounds,<br>Her friendliness, it knows no bounds.<br>Though not all guests are fully rapt,<br>With thirty kilos on their lap.</p>
